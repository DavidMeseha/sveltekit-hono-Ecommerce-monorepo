# SvelteKit E-Commerce Application

This is a monorepo for a simple e-commerce platform built with **SvelteKit** for the frontend and **Hono** for the backend API. The project demonstrates modern web development practices, including RESTful APIs, authentication, and responsive design.

## Apps Structure

- **Frontend** ([apps/Frontend](apps/Frontend)):  
  Built with SvelteKit, provides the user interface for browsing products, managing the cart, placing orders, and viewing reviews. Uses Tailwind CSS for styling and supports environment configuration via `.env`.

- **Backend** ([apps/backend](apps/backend)):  
  Powered by Hono (a lightweight Node.js web framework), exposes REST APIs for products, orders, and reviews. Integrates with Prisma for database management and supports CORS and static file serving.

## Features

- Dynamic product listings with ratings and reviews
- Secure login and token-based authentication
- Order tracking with status progress
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Mobile and desktop responsive design
- Environment configuration via `.env` files

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** SvelteKit, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Hono, Prisma
- **API:** RESTful endpoints for products, orders, reviews
